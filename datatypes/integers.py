# Integers

# In Python 3, integer division works as expected, ie.
# results are automatically translated into a float,
# leading to fewer surprises.
#
# In Python 2, integer division works like it would in
# C, where the fractional part is truncated if the inputs
# were not explicitly cast into floats beforehand

def int_division(a, b):
    return a/b
